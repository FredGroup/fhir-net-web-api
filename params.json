{"name":"Fhir-net-api","tagline":"The official .NET API for HL7 FHIR","body":"fhir-net-api\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is the support API's for working with the HL7 FHIR standard on the .NET platform. The project provides \r\nadditional functionality beyond those in the HL7.Fhir.Model library provided at the FHIR website \r\n(http://www.hl7.org/fhir)\r\n\r\nThis library provides:\r\n* Xml & Json Parsers and serializers for the FHIR object model\r\n* Profile validation functionality\r\n* ValueSet support\r\n* ... more to come\r\n\r\nNote: the parsers and serializers cover the functionality found originally in the HL7.Fhir.Model libraries \r\nprovided on the FHIR website, but are totally rewritten to support profiled FHIR resources. Parsers and \r\nserializers are no longer generated, but use a run-time discovery mechanism so new resources and extensions\r\ncan be added.\r\n\r\nThe current status currently pretty alpha, but this library will support all functionality required for the\r\njanuary 2014 HL7 WGM Connectathon in San Antonio and is kept compatible with the following servers:\r\n\r\n* Furore's (Ewout) - http://spark.furore.com\r\n* Health Intersections (Grahame) - http://hl7connect.healthintersections.com.au/svc/fhir/\r\n* SMART Platforms (Josh) - https://api.fhir.me\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
